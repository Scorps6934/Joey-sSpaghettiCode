/**
 * <h1>S_Arm</h1>
 * This class is a subsystem for the arm. The arm, as I refer to it in code, is strictly the
 * long alumunium bars that are lifted up and down by the motors on the back. While moving the arms does
 * also move the gripper and spinners, they are not affected by the arm subsystem and thus, are not classified
 * as part of the arm. Every action that the arm needs to do is coded into this subsystem. Any action you
 * need to do using the arm would use this subsystem to lay out the steps for the action. The arm subsystem
 * contains objects for the motor controllers that move the arm, a limit switch, and a counter for the limit switch.
 * Ideally, this kind of subsytem should utilize encoders.
