/**
 * <h1>RobotMap</h1>
 * The RobotMap class! This class doesn't really do anything special on it's own but is
 * vital nonetheless. This class is where each electronic component is assigned a port
 * and each input is assigned a button. This is useful because if you need to change the electronics
 * on the robot (which you will) you are able to just change it here, rather than everywhere that is used,
 * which will prevent any ports from being overlooked. Additionally, the less loose numbers you have in your code
 * the more readable and less confusing it will be. Everywhere where you would add a port, you just
 * use robotMap.yourPortHere instead. When you need to add a new port or button mapping, declare it as
 * a <strong>public static final int</strong> to ensure that the values aren't changed.
 * <br> Side note: by convention final variables are usually written in all caps but I opted to keep
 * camel casing in order to maintain readability and because every variable in this class is known to
 * be a final value anyway.
