/**
 * <h1>S_Gripper</h1>
 * This class is a subsystem for the griper. The gripper, as I refer to it in code, is strictly the
 * short alumunium bars on the end of the arm. While moving the gripper does
 * also move the spinners, they are not affected by the gripper subsystem and thus, are not classified
 * as part of the gripper. Every action that the gripper needs to do is coded into this subsystem. Any action you
 * need to do using the arm would use this subsystem to lay out the steps for the action. The gripper subsystem
 * contains objects for the solenoid that opens/closes the gripper.
